# Python Course

The aim of this repository is to provide complex examples to the Python programming language and extended libraries. We focus on four main areas:

- NumPy (Numerical Computing)
- Pandas (Data Analysis)
- Visualisation (Matplotlib)
- Learning (scikit-learn)

The course is covered in Jupyter notebooks which makes things considerably easier. In order to follow this course, we recommend you download Python using the Anaconda distribution as this also provides most of the packages used in this course.
