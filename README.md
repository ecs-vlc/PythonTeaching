# Python Course

Welcome to this Python Course.

The aim of this repository is to provide complex examples to the Python programming language and extended libraries. We focus on five main areas:

- Python Basics
- Numerical Computing
- Data Analysis
- Visualisation
- Machine Learning



The course is covered as interactive Jupyter notebooks which makes things considerably easier. In order to follow this course, we recommend you download Python using the Anaconda distribution (found [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)) as this also provides most of the packages used in this course.
