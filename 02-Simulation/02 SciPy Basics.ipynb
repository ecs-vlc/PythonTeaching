    "_Numpy_ provides a high-performance multidimensional array and basic tools to compute with and manipulate these arrays. **SciPy** builds on this, and provides a large number of functions that operate on numpy arrays and are useful for different types of scientific and engineering applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to get familiar with SciPy is to browse the documentation (found at [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.1.0/reference/tutorial/index.html]). We will highlight some parts of SciPy that you might find useful for this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the Numpy extension of Python. It adds significant power to the interactive Python session by providing the user with high-level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data. With SciPy an interactive Python session becomes a data-processing and system-prototyping environment rivaling systems such as MATLAB, IDL, Octave, R-Lab, and SciLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional benefit of basing SciPy on Python is that this also makes a powerful programming language available for use in developing sophisticated programs and specialized applications. Scientific applications using SciPy benefit from the development of additional modules in numerous niches of the software landscape by developers across the world. Everything from parallel programming to web and data-base subroutines and classes have been made available to the Python programmer. All of this power is available in addition to the mathematical libraries in SciPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will acquaint the first-time user of SciPy with some of its most important features. It assumes that the user has already installed the SciPy package. Some general Python facility is also assumed, such as could be acquired by working through the Python distribution’s Tutorial. For further introductory help the user is directed to the Numpy documentation.\n",
