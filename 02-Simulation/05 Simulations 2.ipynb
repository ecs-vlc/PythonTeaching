These problems will attempt to range over a number of inter-disciplinary fields. Don't worry if you are not able to complete them all within the time of the workshop - they are meant to stretch your abilities, gain some useful NumPy experience and grow some inter-disciplinary knowledge. For these tasks we require that you **only** use NumPy arrays as this is considerably faster and the only tractable method in later examples."
