    "## Reading and Writing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’re working with Python, you don’t need to import a library in order to read and write files. It’s handled natively in the language, albeit in a unique manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you’ll need to do is use Python’s built-in open function to get a file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The open function opens a file. It’s simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use the open function, it returns something called a file object. File objects contain methods and attributes that can be used to collect information about the file you opened. They can also be used to manipulate said file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the mode attribute of a file object tells you which mode a file was opened in. And the name attribute tells you the name of the file that the file object has opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must understand that a _file_ and _file object_ are two wholly separate – yet related – things. \n",
    "\n",
    "### File Types\n",
    "\n",
    "What you may know as a file is slightly different in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Windows, for example, a file can be any item manipulated, edited or created by the user/OS. That means files can be images, text documents, executables, and much more. Most files are organized by keeping them in individual folders. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a file is categorized as either **text** or **binary**, and the difference between the two file types is important. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text files are structured as a sequence of lines, where each line includes a sequence of characters. This is what you know as code or syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each line is terminated with a special character, called the EOL or End of Line character. There are several types, but the most common is the comma {,} or newline character. It ends the current line and tells the interpreter a new one has begun. \n",
    "\n",
    "A backslash character can also be used, and it tells the interpreter that the next character – following the slash – should be treated as a new line. This character is useful when you don’t want to start a new line in the text itself but in the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Open() function\n",
    "\n",
    "This works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    file_object = open(filename, mode)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Where the second argument you see, **mode**, informs the interpreter and developer which way the file will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The available modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **r**: Read mode which is used when the file is only being read.\n",
    "- **w**: Write mode which is used to edit and write new information into the file\n",
    "- **a**: Appending mode, which is used to add new data to the end of the file.\n",
    "- **r+**: Special read and write mode, which is used to handle both actiosn when working with a file\n",
    "\n",
    "Every `open()` should be matched with a `close()`, this allows Python to close the file handle and potentially allow other processes to access it.\n",
    "\n",
