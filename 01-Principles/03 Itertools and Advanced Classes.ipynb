    "# Itertools and Advanced Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "`itertools` represents in Python 3 a heavy part of the Python backbone, and indeed many tasks can be achieved effortlessly through the use of `itertools`. As you may have experimented, one of the primary drawbacks of Python is the slow nature of **looping**, since the Python interpreter is not optimized for handling complex code within a `for` or `while` loop. This aspect will be covered more in the *Performance* notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways around this is by using the `itertools` library suite. Also, the functions themselves are intuitively named, modestly fast, elegant and memory-efficient. `itertools` provides building-block functions inspired by constructs from APL, Haskell and SML. Together they form a kind of \"iterator algebra\" making it possible to construct a specialized tool very succinctly and efficiently in Python. For more on this, look at the `itertools` [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) and this very [helpful guide](https://realpython.com/python-itertools/) where this teaching material is primarily drawn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loosely speaking, this means that functions in `itertools` build on top of iterators to produce more complex ones. For example, `zip()` is an *in-built* Python function which takes an arbitrary number of iterables as arguments and returns an iterator over tuples of their corresponding elements:"
