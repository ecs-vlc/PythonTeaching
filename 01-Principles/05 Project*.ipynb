    "You've covered a lot of material within this chapter; all the way from beginning to learn the basics of Python as a programming language, intermediate and advanced concepts, infinite iteration and complex string operations. Just to quickly recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Fundamentals of Python__: Strings, for loops, lists, dictionaries, if statements\n",
    "2. __Intermediate concepts__: Sets, decorators, IO, Exceptions, `with`, `lambda`\n",
    "3. __Itertools__: Generators, `map`, `zip`, iteration, infinite series\n",
    "4. __Regular expressions__: String manipulation, pattern matching\n",

    "## Developing a game of Hearts\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you're going to be writing a game of Hearts from scratch. The rules of the game are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are 2-4 players.\n",
    "2. Players are initially dealt 13 cards (with 4 players) which they can see.\n",
    "3. The aim is to minimize the number of points they gain over the game. Points are given for each **hand** the player wins.\n",
    "4. *Heart*-suited cards are worth 1 point, the Black Widow (Queen of Spades) is worth 13 points. \n",
    "5. Each hand happens when each player in turn plays one of their cards in the middle. The player with the 2 of Clubs starts, going clockwise. The suit of the first players' card must be followed by all subsequent players, *unless* they do not have a card of that suit. Then they can play whatever card they want.\n",
    "6. The player who plays the highest-value card (Ace counts as high), wins the hand. \n",
    "7. There is no *trump* suit that beats other suits.\n",
    "8. The game is played until everyone runs out of cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Your general aims are several-fold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a deck of cards\n",
    "2. Implement a class `Game` which has the state of the board, and a record of all the played cards.\n",
    "3. Implement a class `Player` that receives a random selection of cards and can make informed decisions, based on the state of the game, which card to play in the next round. This player will act as an AI.\n",
    "4. Run the simulation and calculate how many points each AI player gets, to decide who wins.\n",
    "5. Repeat the simulation multiple times to see if a pattern emerges."
