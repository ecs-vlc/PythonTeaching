    "# Regex\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions (called REs, or regexes, or regex patterns) are essentially a tiny, highly specialized programming language embedded inside Python and made available through the re module. Using this little language, you specify the rules for the set of possible strings that you want to match; this set might contain English sentences, or e-mail addresses, or TeX commands, or anything you like. You can then ask questions such as “Does this string match the pattern?”, or “Is there a match for the pattern anywhere in this string?”. You can also use REs to modify a string or to split it apart in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expression patterns are compiled into a series of bytecodes which are then executed by a matching engine written in C. For advanced use, it may be necessary to pay careful attention to how the engine will execute a given RE, and write the RE in a certain way in order to produce bytecode that runs faster. Optimization isn’t covered in this document, because it requires that you have a good understanding of the matching engine’s internals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regular expression language is relatively small and restricted, so not all possible string processing tasks can be done using regular expressions. There are also tasks that can be done with regular expressions, but the expressions turn out to be very complicated. In these cases, you may be better off writing Python code to do the processing; while Python code will be slower than an elaborate regular expression, it will also probably be more understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll start by learning about the simplest possible regular expressions. Since regular expressions are used to operate on strings, we’ll begin with the most common task: matching characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a detailed explanation of the computer science underlying regular expressions (deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata), you can refer to almost any textbook on writing compilers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matching Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Most letters and characters will simply match themselves. For example, the regular expression test will match the string test exactly. (You can enable a case-insensitive mode that would let this RE match Test or TEST as well; more about this later.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are exceptions to this rule; some characters are special metacharacters, and don’t match themselves. Instead, they signal that some out-of-the-ordinary thing should be matched, or they affect other portions of the RE by repeating them or changing their meaning. Much of this document is devoted to discussing various metacharacters and what they do.\n",

    "        . ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \\ | ( )\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve looked at some simple regular expressions, how do we actually use them in Python? The re module provides an interface to the regular expression engine, allowing you to compile REs into objects and then perform matches with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are compiled into pattern objects, which have methods for various operations such as searching for pattern matches or performing string substitutions."

    "The RE is passed to `re.compile()` as a string. REs are handled as strings because regular expressions aren’t part of the core Python language, and no special syntax was created for expressing them. (There are applications that don’t need REs at all, so there’s no need to bloat the language specification by including them.) Instead, the `re` module is simply a C extension module included with Python, just like the socket or zlib modules.\n",

    "As stated earlier, regular expressions use the backslash character (`'\\'`) to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This conflicts with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you want to write a RE that matches the string `\\section`, which might be found in a LaTeX file. To figure out what to write in the program code, start with the desired string to be matched. Next, you must escape any backslashes and other metacharacters by preceding them with a backslash, resulting in the string `\\\\section`. The resulting string that must be passed to `re.compile()` must be `\\\\section`. However, to express this as a Python string literal, both backslashes must be escaped again.\n",

    "| `\\\\\\\\section` | Escaped backslashes for a string literal |\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, to match a literal backslash, one has to write `'\\\\\\\\'` as the RE string, because the regular expression must be `\\\\`, and each backslash must be expressed as `\\\\` inside a regular Python string literal. In REs that feature backslashes repeatedly, this leads to lots of repeated backslashes and makes the resulting strings difficult to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expressions; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r', so r\"\\n\" is a two-character string containing `'\\'` and `'n'`, while `\"\\n\"` is a one-character string containing a newline. Regular expressions will often be written in Python code using this raw string notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, special escape sequences that are valid in regular expressions, but not valid as Python string literals, now result in a DeprecationWarning and will eventually become a SyntaxError, which means the sequences will be invalid if raw string notation or escaping the backslashes isn’t used.\n",
