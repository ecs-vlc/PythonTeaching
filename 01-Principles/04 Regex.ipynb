    "# Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions (called REs, or regexes, or regex patterns) are essentially a tiny, highly specialized programming language embedded inside Python and made available through the re module. Using this little language, you specify the rules for the set of possible strings that you want to match; this set might contain English sentences, or e-mail addresses, or TeX commands, or anything you like. You can then ask questions such as “Does this string match the pattern?”, or “Is there a match for the pattern anywhere in this string?”. You can also use REs to modify a string or to split it apart in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expression patterns are compiled into a series of bytecodes which are then executed by a matching engine written in C. For advanced use, it may be necessary to pay careful attention to how the engine will execute a given RE, and write the RE in a certain way in order to produce bytecode that runs faster. Optimization isn’t covered in this document, because it requires that you have a good understanding of the matching engine’s internals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regular expression language is relatively small and restricted, so not all possible string processing tasks can be done using regular expressions. There are also tasks that can be done with regular expressions, but the expressions turn out to be very complicated. In these cases, you may be better off writing Python code to do the processing; while Python code will be slower than an elaborate regular expression, it will also probably be more understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The rules of regex\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin with some patterns and using the powerful Regex engine, it's important to cover some groundwork on *how* we make compilable pattern strings. For example, a regex string with characters also takes the *order* of the strings into consideration for a match or search, for example, the regex string:\n",
    "\n",
    "    'Hello'\n",
    "\n",
    "will match to any string that either fully matches `'Hello'` or contains `'Hello'` anywhere in the test string. REs are read **left to right**, and matches by default apply to the *leftmost*/*first* instance within a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repeats of characters\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very common that you might be working with strings with a pre-defined, extractable structure, such as datetime, or URL address, or date of birth. REs use a few qualifying characters to indicate that there is an expansion of the character or selected region, that can either be infinite or fixed by some specified length or bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Qualifier | Example | Description | \n",
    "| ------ | ---- | --------------- |\n",
    "| `*` | `a*` | Match character repeats of 'a' 0 to infinite times |\n",
    "| `+` | `ab+` | Match character repeats of 'b' at least 1 to infinite times |\n",
    "| `?` | `abc?` | Match character repeats of 'c' 0 or 1 only |\n",
    "| `{}` | `Hello{5}` | Match character repeats of 'o' up to 5 times |\n",
    "| `{}` | `atgc{2,5}` | Match character repeats of 'c' between 2 and 5 times |\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that the repeated region only applied in the examples to the **last** character in the sequence before the qualifier. This is important to remember when designing regex strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selections of different characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to define a fixed character that repeats is all well and good, however often in practice we want to match a **range** of characters, such as to match a numerical character between 0 and 9, or a letter between 'a' and 'z'. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we refer back to our *date of birth* example, we want to construct a regex string that follows the patten `YYYY/MM/DD`, where `Y` refers to the year, `M` refers to month and `D` refers to the day. To do this, we want to ensure that the three groups: *year*, *month* and *day* are **numerical** values between 0 and 9, thus a fixed character is inappropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved by selecting the characters of interest within the *square-bracket notation* `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Example | Description | \n",
    "| ------ | --------------- |\n",
    "| `[abc]` | Matches a, b or c |\n",
    "| `[a-z]` | Matches any single lowercase character a-z |\n",
    "| `[0-9]?` | Matches any digit 0-9 zero or once |\n",
    "| `[ATCG]+` | Matches A, T, C or G one or more times |\n",
    "| `[A-Za-z0-9\\_]*` | Matches any uppercase, lowercase, number or underbar zero or more times |\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use a qualifier `?, +, *`, it is recommend to include it *outside* the square-bracket notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming back to the *date of birth* example, our RE may look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [0-9]{4}\\/[0-9]{2}\\/[0-9]{2}\n",
    "    \n",
    "We're looking for 4 digits between 0-9 for the *year*, then followed by a slash, but since it is a special character, we prefix it with `\\`. Then we repeat for two numbers for the *month*, then slash, then two numbers for the *day*. You can see that, by simply learning these two principles, we can already construct coherent REs that can match and manipulate real-world string examples."

(There are applications that don’t need REs at all, so there’s no need to bloat the language specification by including them.) Instead, the `re` module is simply a C extension module included with Python, just like the socket or zlib modules.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s say you want to write a RE that matches the string `\\section`, which might be found in a LaTeX file. To figure out what to write in the program code, start with the desired string to be matched. Next, you must escape any backslashes and other metacharacters by preceding them with a backslash, resulting in the string `\\\\section`. The resulting string that must be passed to `re.compile()` must be `\\\\section`. However, to express this as a Python string literal, both backslashes must be escaped again.\n",

In REs that feature backslashes repeatedly, this leads to lots of repeated backslashes and makes the resulting strings difficult to understand.\n",

    "The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expressions; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r', so r\"\\n\" is a two-character string containing `'\\'` and `'n'`, while `\"\\n\"` is a one-character string containing a newline. Regular expressions will often be written in Python code using this raw string notation.\n",
    "\n",
