    "* **The Iron Throne**: Follows a web of alliances and conflicts among the dynastic noble families of Westeros vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from the throne. \n",
    "* **Last Descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty**: Daenearys Targaryen, exiled to Essos, and plotting a return to the throne.\n",
    "* **The Nights Watch**: A brotherhood charged with defending the realm against the ancient threats of the fierce peoples and legendary creatures that lie far north in the wilderness, and the impending winter that threatens the realm."
